## Dataset Links

- Austin Benson's dataset page is full of interesting graph/hypergraph datasets, many with node and/or edge labels (https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~arb/data/). Perhaps some of the most relevant are:
- Amazon hypergraph: https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~arb/data/amazon-reviews/
- Stackoverflow hypergraph: https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~arb/data/stackoverflow-answers/
- temporal graphs: https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~arb/data/temporal-reddit-reply/ (accompanying paper on temporal motif analysis)
- Tim Davis's suitesparse matrix collection is full of interesting graphs as well. A quick keyword search uncovers some large graphs with node labels, like this one https://sparse.tamu.edu/Sybrandt,
